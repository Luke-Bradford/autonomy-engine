# UI patterns — resource forms

How every create/edit form in studio looks and behaves (#1396, OR5). Written once here; the shared
pieces live in `packages/web/src/lib/form/`. Connections, Datasets, Secrets and Global parameters
follow it. Triggers and the node property panel move onto it in the slices that follow #1396.

## The drawer

- **Create and edit open in a drawer beside the list** (`FormDrawer`). It is a column of the page,
  not an overlay. The list stays readable, and its row actions stay clickable while a form is open.
  On narrow screens the drawer stacks under the list.
- While a drawer is open the page widens by the drawer's width (`.content:has(.drawer-layout-open)`),
  so the list keeps its usual width beside it. Where the window is too narrow even for that, the
  list scrolls sideways inside its own column. It never runs under the drawer.
- The drawer has a header (title and a close button), a body, and a **footer that sticks to the
  bottom of the window**. However long the form is, Save stays in view.
- **Footer actions are right-aligned, with the primary action last**: `Cancel` · secondary actions
  such as `Test connection` · `Save` (class `primary`).
- When the drawer opens, the first field that can be changed gets focus (read-only fields are
  skipped). When it closes, focus goes back to the button
  that opened it (the page passes it as `returnFocusTo`, because an open that went through the
  unsaved-changes prompt leaves focus on the prompt).
- The form's error and result messages sit in the footer above the actions, so a refused Save is
  in view where Save was pressed.
- While a save or test is in flight, Close and Escape wait for it, as Cancel does (`busy`).

## Sections

- The form is grouped into titled sections (`FormSection`, a `fieldset` and `legend`):
  - for a connection: *Basics* (name, kind), *Connection* (the kind's settings), *Authentication*
    (the secret) and *Advanced*;
  - for a dataset: *Basics* (name, store, kind), *Dataset* (the kind's settings), *Columns* (the
    declared schema) and *Advanced*;
  - for a secret: *Basics* (name) and *Value*;
  - for a global parameter: *Basics* (name, type) and *Value* (value, description).
- **Advanced is collapsed by default**, and opens by default when the record already uses it, so
  stored state is never hidden. The override allowlist lives there (`OverridableKeysSection`).

## Labels, hints and required fields

- **Human labels come from the schema**, not from a list in the web package. Tag a field with
  `presented(schema, { title, description?, unit? })` from `shared/schemas/field-presentation.ts`,
  and `ConfigFieldControl` renders:
  - the title, with the unit in brackets ("Timeout (ms)");
  - the description, with the stored key in code type, as a hint under the control (linked with
    `aria-describedby`).

  Keep the key visible: server errors, advisories and `${}` expressions all cite it.
- `unit` names what the stored value is in. It never converts the value.
- Kinds and other enum identifiers show a display name (`CONNECTION_KIND_LABELS`,
  `DATASET_KIND_LABELS`). The stored value stays the identifier.
- A field's title must not contain another label on the same form ("Name", "Kind", "Store"):
  label lookups by substring, in tests and in assistive tech, would then find two controls.
- **Required fields get an asterisk and `aria-required`** (native `required` on a plain input).
  Optional fields are unmarked: schema-derived fields no longer carry an "(optional)" suffix (a few
  hand-written labels outside `ConfigFieldControl`, in the canvas and trigger editors, still do
  until their forms move onto this pattern). The asterisk is `RequiredMark`.
  CSS draws it, and it is `aria-hidden`, so it never becomes part of a field's name. A row list is a
  `group` and cannot take `aria-required`, so it gets the asterisk alone.
- A field that cannot change on an edit (a secret's name, a global's name and type) is
  **read-only, not disabled**, so it stays reachable by keyboard and screen reader, and it carries
  no asterisk: it asks nothing of the operator. When the drawer opens, focus skips read-only
  fields and lands on the first one that can be changed.
- A secret input has a **Show/Hide** toggle, named "Show secret" or "Hide secret" to match what it
  does next. The toggle sits beside the label, not inside it.

## Leaving a form with unsaved changes

A page holds its open form with `useDrawerForm(signatureOf)`. The hook returns the form, the
open counter the form is keyed on, the opener ref focus returns to, the guard below, and three
actions: `openFrom(button, open)` (through the guard), `requestClose()`, and `closeIfLatest(seq)`
for a save that lands after another form has opened. `signatureOf` is what Save would write as one
string: `payloadSignature([...])` over the fields Save sends, with the config read through
`saveableConfigOf` (both in `pages/pipeline/configForm.ts`).

`useUnsavedChangesGuard(dirty)` holds every way out of a dirty form at one prompt in the drawer's
footer ("You have unsaved changes. Discard them?" with **Keep editing** and **Discard changes**):

- Cancel, Close, Escape, and opening another record's form all go through `guard.request(action)`.
- A route change is held by `guard.routeHold`, which the page renders. It is mounted only while
  the form is dirty, because React Router warns about any registered blocker on a navigation it
  did not create.
- Closing or reloading the tab is held by the browser's own `beforeunload` prompt.

"Dirty" compares what Save would write against the value when the form opened. Switching between
the fields view and the JSON view is not an edit.

The prompt is an inline `alertdialog`, not `window.confirm`. OR6 (#1397) owns the app's confirm
dialogs.

## Still to come under #1396

- Inline validation on blur in a reserved slot, plus an error summary on submit that focuses the
  first invalid field.
- Typed number controls (min/max). Number fields stay text inputs today, for the reason given in
  `ConfigFieldControl`: a native number input reports a typo as empty, which would silently delete
  the setting.
- A JSON code editor, kind icons, and a two-column grid on wide screens.
- Axe gates on every form (shared with OR24, #1415).
