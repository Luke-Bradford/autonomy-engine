/**
 * P3 — the CONNECTOR ADAPTER contract (target-architecture "connector model").
 * A connector kind is a plugin: given a Connection's non-secret `config` and its
 * just-in-time-resolved `secret`, it runs an activity and STREAMS results. The
 * adapter is the ONLY place a plaintext secret is used — the executor fetches +
 * decrypts it at dispatch and passes it here as a separate argument; it never
 * enters `ActivityContext` (which may be logged) or any persisted event.
 *
 * A SECOND secret channel (item 7 / S3, the unified secret model): a config
 * field declared a secret SINK (`ActivityCatalogEntry.secretSinkFields`) may
 * carry a `{ "$secret": "<name>" }` marker, which the executor resolves at
 * dispatch into `secretFields` — the optional third `runActivity` argument,
 * keyed by CONFIG PATH (e.g. `secretHeaders.X-Api-Key`) → plaintext. Like
 * `secret`, it is a separate arg, NEVER merged into `ctx.input`/`preparedInput`
 * or any event; `ctx.input` retains only the inert `{$secret:name}` MARKER (a
 * name, safe to log). An adapter that declares no sink ignores it.
 */

/**
 * The PROVIDER-facing error taxonomy (mined + review). It classifies WHY an
 * activity failed, in the terms a provider actually reports.
 * - `auth`      — bad/again-needed credentials (a `secret` problem).
 * - `rate_limit`— throttled by the provider; a backoff-retry candidate.
 * - `transient` — network blip / 5xx / timeout; a retry candidate.
 * - `permanent` — a request that will never succeed as-is (bad input, 4xx-ish).
 * - `cancelled` — aborted via the `AbortSignal` (run cancel / shutdown).
 *
 * This is NOT the engine's taxonomy: the executor maps every kind onto the
 * 3-valued `FailureKind` (the reducer's retry-decision axis) via
 * `error-kind.ts::toEngineFailure`, keeping the narrowed-away detail in
 * `node.failed.code`. The kind is a FIELD on the event — never formatted into
 * the message (#1 F0). Retry itself is still not wired (F2b).
