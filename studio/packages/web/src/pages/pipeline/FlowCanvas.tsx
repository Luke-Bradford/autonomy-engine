 * array (via `useNodesState`) so it can attach and keep each node's measured
 * dimensions across renders — deriving brand-new node objects every render
 * would drop `measured` and make connected edges flicker on every drag tick.
 * The two are reconciled: store changes (add/delete/config/connection/select)
 * flow INTO the view array preserving each surviving node's live position and
 * measured size; view changes (drag/remove/select) flow BACK into the store.
 * Edges, which carry no measured state, are derived straight from the store.
 * `onlyRenderVisibleElements` keeps a large graph responsive.
 *
 * SELECTION is a round trip (#737), and the store is the authority at both ends:
 * React Flow reports a selection as a `select` CHANGE, which the handlers below
 * fold into the store; the store then re-derives `selected` for every node and
 * edge. See `applySelectChange` for why the change handlers — not
 * `onSelectionChange` — are the seam, and the `selected:` line in the reconcile
 * effect for why the view must not be allowed to disagree.
 *
 * The regression check the epic asks for is `e2e/canvas-drag-reconciliation.spec.ts`
 * (U6a). Do NOT try to replace it with a unit test: "an unrelated store change
 * does not remount an existing node" does NOT discriminate, because React keys
 * node elements by id, so DOM identity survives even if the carry-forward below
 * is deleted outright (U5 confirmed that by mutation and deleted the test). The
 * property only diverges while a drag is IN FLIGHT, when the view position
 * leads the domain position and `measured` is already populated — neither of
 * which jsdom can produce, and neither of which survives a settled drag. Both
 * halves of the carry-forward were mutation-checked against that spec.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMIT, for U17/U9/U22: `position` here is carried forward
 * UNCONDITIONALLY, so once a node is in the view array a DOMAIN position write
 * never reaches the screen. That is exactly right mid-drag and wrong for
 * undo-of-a-move (U17), auto-layout (U9) and restore-version (U22), which are
 * all domain position writes. Whoever builds those needs a "domain wins"
 * escape hatch (a move generation/epoch, or clearing the view entry on a
 * programmatic move) — not a relaxation of this line, which the spec above
 * pins.
