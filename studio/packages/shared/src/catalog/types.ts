 *  - `execution` — **connector-dispatched**: the driver hands it to a connector
 *    adapter over a Connection (I/O, `idempotent`, policy retry/timeout).
 *  - `control` — **engine-evaluated**: a pure reducer transition with no
 *    connector and no I/O (`if`/`switch`/`wait`/`set_variable`, spec #4). It
 *    still carries security metadata — control activities handle values too.
 *
 * NOTE the mechanism by which the REDUCER learns a node is control is NOT
 * settled by a spec and is NOT decided here: #4's A1/A2 may read this `kind`
 * (which needs the catalog injected into `createEngine`) or use a structural
 * config discriminant — the precedent being `call_pipeline`, which is already
 * engine-evaluated via `Node.call` and is not catalogued at all (A9 surfaces
 * it). This field is the contract #1 D6 mandates either way.
