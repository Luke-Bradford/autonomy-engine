/**
 * #1 F2c — the `node_retry` alarm handler: the consumer that closes D4's retry
 * loop, and #5 S1's first real one.
 *
 * The whole retry path, end to end:
 *   1. `node.failed{kind:'transient'}` with policy budget → the reducer folds the
 *      node to `retry_pending` and emits `scheduleRetry` (F2b, pure).
 *   2. `driver.ts`'s `armRetry` arms a durable alarm, then appends
 *      `node.retryScheduled{nextAttemptAt}` (F2c, the clock's half).
 *   3. the alarm comes due → THIS handler appends `node.retryDue`, whose fold
 *      re-dispatches the node under a new attempt.
 *
 * This handler is the ONLY thing that resolves a HOLD (§A.5): `onResumed`
 * re-derives nothing for a `retry_pending` node and the boot reconciler does not
 * select it, so a held run's entire recovery is the durable alarm row this
 * consumes. That is why F2b could not ship without this — F2b alone is a hang,
 * not a degraded retry.
 *
 * The boot reconciler is the ONE other party that touches this kind's rows, and
 * only to re-arm a hold whose alarm the HOLD→ARM crash window lost. It does not
 * fire them.
