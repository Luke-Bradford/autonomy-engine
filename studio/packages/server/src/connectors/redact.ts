 * P3b — secret redaction for connector error messages. A caught error thrown by
 * `fetch`/the runtime can embed a value we passed IN — most dangerously, Node's
 * header-validation `TypeError` quotes the offending header value verbatim
 * (`Headers.append: "<value>" is an invalid header value.`). When that value is
 * a resolved API-key secret (a key with an embedded CR/LF, say), echoing the
 * error into a durable `node.failed` event would leak the plaintext key at rest.
 *
 * Every adapter that echoes an error message therefore redacts its OUTGOING
 * header/secret values first. Redaction is a literal substring replace (no regex
 * escaping pitfalls); an empty/nullish value is skipped so it can never turn a
 * whole message into `***`.

 * output that legitimately nests this deep does not exist, so the cap only ever
 * trips on hostile input; when it does, the over-deep subtree is replaced

 * leaf; non-string leaves (number/boolean/null) pass through untouched — a
 * secret is a string, so only string leaves can carry one. The tree is rebuilt
 * (never mutated in place). Same accepted tradeoff as `redactSecrets`: a
 * legitimate string that merely CONTAINS a secret substring is redacted too —
 * the safe side, and unavoidable without provenance tracking. Recursion is
 * bounded by `MAX_REDACT_DEPTH` (see there) — a subtree deeper than that is
 * replaced by the sentinel rather than walked.
