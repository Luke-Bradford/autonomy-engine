 * The read-only context a `${...}` expression resolves against. PURE input:
 * everything the language can see lives here, nothing is fetched.
 *
 * - `params`   — resolved run params by name. SECRET-typed params are STRIPPED
 *                before a context is built (see `resolveRunParams`), so a
 *                secret value can never enter substitution or an error message.
 * - `nodeOutputs` — a node's declared outputs, populated ONLY once that node has
 *                reached a terminal `node.succeeded` (partial outputs never feed
 *                substitution). Keyed by nodeId, then by output name.
 * - `nodeStatuses` — every node's CURRENT status, backing `${nodes.<id>.status}`
 *                (#6 E3 T6). Deliberately the whole `NodeRunStatus`, not just the
 *                terminal subset: the map reports what the run knows, and
 *                REFUSING a non-terminal read is the resolver's judgement, not a
 *                gap in the data. Equally deliberately a status-only projection
 *                rather than `RunState.nodes` itself — `attempts` /
 *                `currentAttemptId` are engine bookkeeping and must not become
 *                readable by the expression language.
 * - `run`      — a CLOSED field set describing the current run's identity (see
 *                `RUN_FIELDS`). `${run.<field>}` may read only these names.
 * - `trigger`  — the run's fire-time TRIGGER context (#5 S12), backing
 *                `${trigger.<field>}` over a CLOSED field set (see
 *                `TRIGGER_FIELDS`): `triggerId`, `scheduledTime` (the scheduled
 *                occurrence for a `schedule` fire; `null` otherwise), and `body`
 *                (the webhook/event/run-now payload; `json`, deep-addressable).
 *                Its values are the durable `run.triggerContext` seed FACT folded
 *                into `RunState.triggerContext` — never a fresh read — so every
 *                field is stable across the whole run and identical on replay.
 *                `windowStart`/`windowEnd` (#5 S11b, `TRIGGER_WINDOW_FIELDS`)
 *                also flatten here via `triggerRoot` but are always `null` in a
 *                REDUCER context: the seed event does not carry them (they are
 *                launcher-context/run-ROW facts, the `windowEpoch` discipline),
 *                and save-time context-scoping keeps them out of node configs —
 *                they are read only by a tumbling trigger's param bindings,
 *                resolved in the launcher at fire time.

// P2b — the event-sourced run engine's state, events, and commands (Zod SSOT).
//
// The reducer (`engine/reduce.ts`) is PURE: `reduce(state, event) → { state,
// commands, diagnostics }`. `run_events` (P1a) is the append-only source of
// truth; `RunState` is a projection = fold `reduce` over the log. A COMMAND
// never mutates state — the DRIVER performs it and appends the resulting EVENT,
// and only folding that event changes state (so a crash between "command
// emitted" and "event appended" simply re-emits the command on replay).
// ===========================================================================

/**
 * A single node's execution state within a run.
 * - `pending`    — not yet ready (incoming edges unsatisfied).
 * - `ready`      — the reducer decided to dispatch it (a `dispatchNode` command
 *                  was emitted and its `currentAttemptId` minted) and is awaiting
 *                  the driver's `node.dispatched` event.
 * - `dispatched` — the driver accepted the dispatch (`node.dispatched` folded).
 * - `success` / `failure` — terminal, from `node.succeeded` / `node.failed`.
 * - `skipped`    — an incoming edge became impossible under the join rule.
 * - `waiting`    — a `call_pipeline` node that emitted `startChild` and is
 *                  awaiting its `call.returned` event (P2c).
 * - `retry_pending` — F2b/D4's **HOLD**: a `transient` failure the node's policy
 *                  still has budget for. NON-terminal, which is the whole design
 *                  (see below), and resolved only by a `node.retryDue`.
 * - `wait_pending` — #4 A5/A6's durable **PARK**: a `wait` control node paused on
 *                  S1's alarm. NON-terminal, resolved only by a `timer.due`. It
 *                  is entered by `timer.waitScheduled` — which the driver appends
 *                  AFTER arming the alarm — so a `wait_pending` node ALWAYS has a
 *                  live alarm row (unlike `retry_pending`, entered by `node.failed`
 *                  BEFORE the arm, which is why retry needs a boot re-arm and wait
 *                  does not).
 * - `external_wait_pending` — #4 A13's durable **external PARK**: a `webhook`
 *                  control node paused awaiting an inbound HTTP callback. NON-
 *                  terminal, resolved by `externalWait.completed` (→ `success`) or
 *                  `externalWait.expired` (→ `failure`). Entered by
 *                  `externalWait.created` — appended by the driver AFTER arming the
 *                  expiry alarm + correlation row — so it too ALWAYS has a live
 *                  alarm (the same arm-before-append discipline as `wait_pending`).
 *                  The twin of `wait_pending` with a DIFFERENT resume source (an
 *                  inbound callback, not a timer).
 *
 * `retry_pending`/`wait_pending`/`external_wait_pending` are deliberately ABSENT from
 * `TerminalNodeStatusSchema`, and that single fact is what implements the HOLD/PARK
 * — no new predicate anywhere:
 * `TERMINAL_NODE` excludes it, so `endpointOutcome` returns `null`, every
 * readiness/outcome path treats the node as live, `allTopLevelTerminal` is false
 * (so the run cannot finish while a node is held), a container's
 * `children.every(TERMINAL_NODE)` gate waits for it, and `${nodes.<id>.status}`
 * refuses to read it. See the joint F1b/F2b spec §A.1/§B.1.
 *
 * `attempts` is a monotonic counter minted-from, not random: every dispatch
 * takes `attemptId = \`${nodeId}#${attempts}\`` then increments. A result event
 * whose `attemptId` is not the node's `currentAttemptId` is stale and ignored.

   *
   *  1. **Off by one.** `attempts` is incremented at DISPATCH (`reduce.ts`
   *     mints `attemptId` from `attempts`, then increments), so it is already 1
   *     at the first `node.failed`. `attempts < retry` therefore delivers
   *     `retry: N` → N total attempts, where F2a's schema contract says
   *     "`retry: 2` = up to 3 attempts" — and makes an explicit `retry: 1`
   *     silently identical to `retry: 0`, the exact confusion §A.3's
   *     absent-vs-explicit-0 rule exists to prevent.
   *  2. **Loop rounds spend the budget.** `attempts` is kept MONOTONIC across a
   *     back-edge reset (§A.6, and correctly so — it is what makes a stale
   *     result from the prior round unfoldable). Keying eligibility on it makes
   *     the retry budget run-LIFETIME: a loop-body node with `retry: 2` retries
   *     in round 1 and, from round 3 on, has none — spent by BOUNCES, not by
   *     failures.
   *
   * A separate counter fixes both at once and keeps §A.6 intact: `attempts`
   * stays monotonic for attempt-id minting, `retries` counts policy retries and
   * is CLEARED by `resetNodes` so every round gets its own budget. It also keeps
   * the rule reading exactly like its English contract ("max retries after the
   * first attempt"), with no off-by-one to re-break.
   *
   * It is incremented ONLY by `node.retryDue`. Boot-recovery's
   * `node.retryRequested` does NOT touch it: re-running a node the crash lost is
   * not a policy retry, and must not consume the operator's budget. That
   * three-way conflation (policy retry / boot retry / loop round) is precisely
   * what `attempts` alone cannot express.
