"""Lifecycle control decisions for the P2 control surface (issue #10).

The safety boundary lives here as a pure `control_plan()` that, given a repo +
action + the resolved launchd service, returns exactly WHAT to do:

  - pause / resume  -> a file touch/remove of the graceful-stop sentinel
  - stop / start    -> a specific `launchctl bootout|bootstrap` argv, and ONLY
                       that -- never a free-form command

The server executes the plan; it never builds commands itself. So every safety
property (only launchctl, start refuses without an installed plist, unknown
actions do nothing) is unit-tested without running launchctl or touching real
LaunchAgents. Lifecycle only -- this module has no notion of any target-repo
trade/order/position path and can never touch one.
